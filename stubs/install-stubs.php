 * Installs this starter kit's documentation stubs into a freshly scaffolded project.
 *
 * The kit's own CLAUDE.md and .solo/ are export-ignored (see .gitattributes): they describe the KIT,
 * not the app you just scaffolded, and an agent that reads them as authoritative will open PRs
 * against the starter kit repo instead of yours. The files in stubs/ are the generic replacements.
 *
 * Composer runs this from post-create-project-cmd, after which stubs/ deletes itself.
 *
 * Every step is guarded, so running this twice — or in a project that already has its own docs — is
 * a no-op. An existing file is never overwritten.
